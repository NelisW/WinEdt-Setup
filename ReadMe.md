# WinEdt setup

This repository contains a description and data files for my WinEdt setup process.

Get WinEdt here: http://www.winedt.com/


WinEdt.tex is the root document that uses the format.
I like to keep pictures in subdirectories and chapters in separate files.
Check it out, it works for me.
